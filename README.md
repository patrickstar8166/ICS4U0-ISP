Instructions Manual:

1. Overall:

Our game will implement our theme of foraging by teaching children which plants are safe to pick and eat, and which are not. 
We then simulate the experience of foraging in the wild to further the userâ€™s understanding by having them act out the proper procedures. 
A heavy emphasis will be placed on safe identification through simple visual cues, as this will be most pertinent to children. 
There are three levels within the game with their details listed below:

Level 1: Learning level
This level involves various slides users can navigate through that provide detailed information about foods both edible and inedible
This level will focus on providing information to the user 
After going through all given slides in this level, users will be able to move onto the next level to test their knowledge 

Level 2: Test level
This level will allow users to move horizontally through a specifically designed room
Users will have to interact with a certain amount of interactable objects on the screen before completing the level as well as getting the prompts from said objects correct
These interactable objects will receive user input to open a new screen, here the user will be tested on specific edible foods (which varies depending on which object was interacted with)
If the user selects the wrong option, an error message will be displayed prompting the user to select the right option 
If the user selects the correct option a congratulatory message will display and the user will be prompted back to the room where they will be able to interact with other items until the level is completed
When all objects are interacted with, the player may continue to the final level

Level 3: Adventure level
This is the final level where users will be put into an open area and are required to forage for as much edible food as possible by walking around with key controls before the timer (daylight) runs out 
Users will have interactable locations to select edible foods 
Users will not be told if their selected foods are edible or not
To properly harvest the foods, users will have to complete a minigame
At the end of the timer, the foods that the user foraged are displayed, and a win/loss message is displayed. The loss message is descriptive of why the loss occurred.
To win the game after the timer is concluded, the user must have a sufficient amount of foraged goods, as well as no harmful goods


This game is only a 1 player game that will only require user interaction from one person through the keyboard 

Players are required to complete the learning level and test level before moving onto the final level
All levels must be played in sequential order, the option to play the next successive level will be only displayed once all the content in the level is completed


2. Objective: 

Our game focuses on teaching safe foraging for childrens aged 5-10. 
This game will not only educate users about safe foraging practices and identification, but also tests users in a fun and engaging way. 
Foraging has become an increasingly popular pastime, with many children participating in foraging with their parents. 
However, children are often more susceptible to picking unhealthy plants or fungi, because they lack experience.
There has been multiple cases in the past of children eating poisonous mushrooms, which led to some unfortunate deaths.
For children, it's easy to mistake a toxic species for an edible one. Statistics show that out of all the mushroom-ingestion cases of hospitalization, the majority of the reported cases are children under six years old eating everything they can get their hands on, not understanding the consequences. 
As such, this game focuses on teaching children about safe foraging from a young age to ensure their safety.
