To navigate on this page, please use the arrow buttons by clicking with a mouse/trackpad! This single-player game is intended to teach kids aged 5-10 about foraged plants in a fun and engaging way. As the game progresses through the three levels, the difficulty increases. As well, all levels must be played in sequential order, where the previous level must be successfully done.", 
   "This level involves various slides you will navigate through. They will provide detailed information about foods that are edible and inedible (this will be tested in the later levels). The main goal of this level is not to be tested, but to learn. After going through all given slides in this level, users will be given access to the next level in the game. Please navigate through this level simply by clicking the arrows on the screen. This will change the slides and change the content being displayed. Have fun!",
   "This level involves a pre-set path to navigate, using the arrow keys. Through the path, there will be checkpoints to test your knowledge on the different plants to be foraged (red squares). A screen will pop up asking for the answer. The answer can be selected by clicking the correct option. After you reach the end, the third level can be played. This will test you on your forage knowledge, so have fun!",
   "This level involves a free-roam path that you will navigate, using the arrow keys. On the map, there will be randomly spawned items. These items may be dangerous OR safe, so choose carefully! Whether the item is safe or not will not be directly prompted until the end screen, which will tell you if what you've chosen is good! During this time, you will have to collect the right items and enough items before the 2 minute timer (right corner) runs out! Afterwards, your results will be displayed. During the game you can view your inventory by pressing \"i\". To pick up an item, press \"z\". A mini-game will be displayed where you will be asked to collect enough of the item while avoiding getting stung by the bees. If you are stung too much, you will not be able to collect the item. You will have successfully collected the item if the green bar is full. Collect 6 edible items before the timer runs out! If you collect any inedible plants, you will lose."};
